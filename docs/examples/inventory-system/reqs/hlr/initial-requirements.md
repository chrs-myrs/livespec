# Inventory Management System Requirements

**From**: Operations Team
**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Priority**: High

## Business Need

We need a system to track inventory across our 3 warehouses. Currently using spreadsheets which leads to:
- Stockouts costing us $2.3M annually
- Excess inventory tying up $5M in capital
- 3-4 hours daily spent on manual reconciliation
- No real-time visibility into stock levels

## Key Requirements

### Must Have
- Track products across multiple warehouses
- Real-time stock level updates
- Low stock alerts
- Basic reporting (current stock, movement history)
- Integration with our existing order system (REST API)
- Support for 200+ concurrent warehouse users

### Nice to Have
- Predictive analytics for reorder points
- Mobile app for warehouse staff
- Barcode scanning support
- Integration with supplier systems

## Constraints
- Budget: $200K for development
- Timeline: MVP in 3 months
- Must work with existing PostgreSQL database
- Cannot modify existing order system
- Must comply with SOX requirements for audit trail

## Success Criteria
- Reduce stockouts by 80%
- Reduce excess inventory by 30%
- Eliminate manual reconciliation time
- 99.9% uptime during business hours (6 AM - 8 PM PST)

## Stakeholders
- **Sponsor**: CFO (cost reduction focus)
- **Primary Users**: Warehouse staff (200 people)
- **Secondary Users**: 
  - Purchasing team (reorder decisions)
  - Finance team (inventory valuation)
  - Sales team (availability checking)

## Technical Environment
- 3 warehouses with reliable internet
- Existing systems run on AWS
- PostgreSQL 14 for main database
- All users have modern web browsers
- Some warehouses have spotty WiFi in certain areas

## Open Questions
- How often does inventory data need to sync? Real-time or batch?
- What specific reports are needed?
- Should we track serialized inventory or just quantities?
- What are the specific SOX requirements?
- How do we handle returns and damaged goods?
