# System Purpose

**System Name**: Inventory Management System
**Document Status**: Current
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-03
**HLR Source**: initial-requirements.md

## Executive Summary

The Inventory Management System provides real-time visibility and control over inventory across multiple warehouses, reducing stockouts by 80% and excess inventory by 30% while eliminating manual reconciliation work.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The operations team currently manages inventory across 3 warehouses using spreadsheets, resulting in:
- $2.3M annual losses from stockouts when products show as available but aren't
- $5M in working capital tied up in excess inventory due to poor visibility
- 3-4 hours daily of manual work reconciling inventory levels
- No real-time visibility causing poor customer experience and rushed decisions

### Business Value
- **Cost Reduction**: Save $1.8M annually from reduced stockouts (80% of $2.3M)
- **Capital Efficiency**: Free up $1.5M in working capital (30% of $5M)
- **Labor Savings**: Eliminate 1,000+ hours/year of manual reconciliation
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Accurate availability improves order fulfillment

### Strategic Alignment
Supports company's 2024 initiatives for:
- Digital transformation of operations
- Working capital optimization
- Customer experience improvement
- Data-driven decision making

## System Scope

### Included Capabilities
- Multi-warehouse inventory tracking
- Real-time stock level updates
- Automated low-stock alerts
- Movement history tracking
- Standard inventory reports
- Integration with existing order system
- Audit trail for SOX compliance

### Excluded Capabilities
- Modifying the existing order system
- Supplier system integrations (Phase 2)
- Predictive analytics (Phase 2)
- Mobile applications (Phase 2)
- Barcode scanning (Phase 2)

## Users and Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Warehouse Staff** (200 users): Update inventory, receive alerts, check stock
- **Purchasing Team** (10 users): Monitor levels, generate reorder reports

### Secondary Users
- **Finance Team** (5 users): Inventory valuation reports, audit trails
- **Sales Team** (50 users): Check real-time availability

### Key Stakeholders
- **CFO**: Sponsor focused on cost reduction and capital efficiency
- **Operations VP**: Needs reliable system for 3 warehouses
- **Compliance Officer**: Requires SOX-compliant audit trails

## Success Metrics

### Business Metrics
- Stockout incidents: Current 850/year → Target <170/year
- Excess inventory value: Current $5M → Target <$3.5M
- Reconciliation hours: Current 1,000/year → Target 0

### Operational Metrics
- System availability: 99.9% during business hours (6 AM - 8 PM PST)
- Data sync latency: <5 seconds for stock updates
- Report generation: <10 seconds for standard reports
- Concurrent users: Support 200+ simultaneous users

## Constraints and Compliance

### Business Rules
- Inventory adjustments require reason codes
- Negative inventory not allowed
- All changes must be traceable to user
- Cycle counts required monthly

### Regulatory Requirements
- SOX compliance for public company
- Immutable audit trail required
- Role-based access control
- Data retention for 7 years

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing PostgreSQL database
- Cannot modify order system interfaces
- Must work with current AWS infrastructure
- Limited to $200K development budget

## Privacy and Security

### Data Classification
- **PII Handled**: No
- **Data Types**: Product data, quantities, locations, prices
- **Retention**: 7 years for audit trail, 2 years for operational data

### Security Requirements
- Authentication via existing corporate SSO
- Role-based permissions (warehouse, purchasing, finance, read-only)
- Encrypted data in transit and at rest
- Audit log of all data modifications

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- **Order Management System**: Read orders, update availability (REST API)
- **Financial System**: Nightly inventory valuation export (CSV)
- **Corporate SSO**: User authentication (SAML)

### Dependencies
- Order system provides product master data
- SSO provides user roles and permissions
- Financial system consumes inventory valuations

## Assumptions and Risks

### Key Assumptions
- All warehouses have reliable internet connectivity
- Order system API remains stable
- Current PostgreSQL can handle load
- Users have modern web browsers

### Major Risks
- **Warehouse Connectivity**: Some areas have spotty WiFi (Impact: High, Mitigation: Offline capability)
- **Data Migration**: Historical data quality unknown (Impact: Medium, Mitigation: Validation scripts)
- **User Adoption**: Change from spreadsheets (Impact: Medium, Mitigation: Training plan)

## Future Considerations

### Growth Expectations
- 4th warehouse planned for Q4 2024
- Transaction volume growing 20% annually
- International expansion may require multi-currency

### Potential Enhancements
- Mobile app for warehouse staff
- Predictive analytics for reorder points
- Supplier integration for automated ordering
- Barcode/RFID scanning support
- Advanced analytics and dashboards
