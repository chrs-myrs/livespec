## Component Build Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
| Order | Component | Dependencies | Duration | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|

| 2 | Core Domain Models | Database | 2 days | [x] |
| 3 | Redis Cache Layer | Database | 1 day | [x] |
| 4 | Authentication Service | Core Models | 2 days | [x] |

### Phase 2: Core Services (Week 3-4)
| Order | Component | Dependencies | Duration | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| 5 | Inventory Service | Event Store, Redis | 5 days | [x] |
| 6 | Warehouse Manager | Inventory Service | 4 days | [ ] |
| 7 | Sync Manager | Redis, Services | 3 days | [ ] |

### Phase 3: Features (Week 5-6)

| 12 | SSO Integration | Auth Service | 2 days | [ ] |
| 13 | Financial Export | Reporting | 2 days | [ ] |

## Dependency Management

### Critical Path
```
Database → Event Store → Inventory Service → Warehouse Manager → API Gateway → Integrations
                    ↓                              ↓
                Redis Cache                   Sync Manager
                                                  ↓
                                            Offline Queue
```

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Redis Cache setup while building Event Store
- Alert System while building Reporting Engine
- SSO integration while building API Gateway

## Resource Allocation

### Team Assignments
| Developer | Primary Components | Secondary |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Sarah | Database, Event Store | Redis |
| Michael | Inventory Service, Sync | Alerts |

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
| Point | Components | Protocol | Test Strategy |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Inventory Updates | Service → Event Store | Events | Integration Tests |
| Real-time Sync | Redis → Clients | WebSocket | Load Tests |
| Offline Sync | Queue → Sync Manager | HTTP | Chaos Tests |

### External Integrations
| System | Component | Timeline | Contact |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Order System | API Gateway | Week 7 | John (Orders Team) |
| Corporate SSO | Auth Service | Week 7 | IT Security |
| Financial System | Reporting | Week 7 | Finance Tech |

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Offline sync conflicts | High | Event sourcing + CRDT | Chen |
| Redis failover time | Medium | Redis Sentinel setup | Michael |
| SOX audit concerns | High | Immutable event log | Sarah |

### Schedule Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Order API changes | 3 days | Mock interface first | Maria |
| WiFi testing delays | 2 days | Local env simulation | Chen |
