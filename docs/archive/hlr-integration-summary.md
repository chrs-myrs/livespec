# HLR Integration and Progress Update Summary

## Overview

The bidirectional specifications framework now supports high-level requirements (HLR) as input and includes a utility for updating progress reports from current project state.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. HLR Folder Structure

Added `reqs/hlr/` folder to the standard structure:
```
reqs/
├── hlr/              # NEW: High-level requirements input
│   ├── *.md          # User-provided requirements
│   ├── *.txt         # Various formats supported
│   └── *.doc         # Original requirement docs
├── progress-report.md
└── ... (other folders)
```

### 2. HLR Integration Points

#### Project Setup (0.1)
- Creates hlr/ folder during initialization
- Checks for existing requirements documents
- Suggests moving them to reqs/hlr/
- Notes HLR files in initial progress report

#### Purpose Documentation (1.1)
- Automatically reads from reqs/hlr/
- Extracts requirements and transforms to purpose
- Maintains traceability to source HLR files
- Documents which requirements came from which files

### 3. Progress Update Utility

Created `update-progress-report.md` prompt that:
- Analyzes current project state
- Detects completed documentation
- Checks for code implementation
- Updates progress percentages accurately
- Identifies gaps and next steps
- Useful for:
  - Projects that started without tracking
  - Catching up after manual work
  - Regular progress audits

### 4. Updated Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added hlr/ to file structure, noted in workflow
- **User Guide**: Added HLR workflow examples and progress update
- **Setup Prompt**: Creates hlr/ folder and checks for requirements
- **Purpose Prompt**: Reads from hlr/ automatically

## Benefits

### For HLR Support
1. **Clear input mechanism** - Users know where to put requirements
2. **Automatic processing** - Purpose prompt reads HLR automatically
3. **Traceability** - Links maintained from HLR to all specs
4. **Flexibility** - Supports various document formats
5. **Integration** - Works seamlessly with existing workflow

### For Progress Updates
1. **Catch-up capability** - Update progress anytime
2. **Accuracy** - Analyzes actual state, not assumptions
3. **Gap identification** - Shows what's missing
4. **Next steps** - Recommends logical progression
5. **Flexibility** - Works for any project state

## Usage Examples

### Starting with Requirements
```bash
# 1. Setup project
claude-code "Use prompts/0.1-setup-project.md"

# 2. Add requirements
cp my-requirements.md reqs/hlr/
cp user-stories.txt reqs/hlr/

# 3. Generate purpose from HLR
claude-code "Use prompts/1.1-write-purpose.md"
```

### Updating Progress
```bash
# Analyze current state and update
claude-code "Use prompts/update-progress-report.md"
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Backward Compatible** - Existing projects work unchanged
2. **Optional Usage** - HLR folder can be empty
3. **Format Agnostic** - Supports any text format for HLR
4. **Automatic Discovery** - Prompts find and process HLR files
5. **Progress Tracking** - Integrated with stage-based workflow

The framework now provides a complete path from initial requirements through implementation with full progress visibility.
