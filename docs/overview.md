# Bidirectional Specifications System - Overview

## What is This System?

The Bidirectional Specifications System is a living documentation framework that maintains synchronized specifications throughout your software lifecycle. Unlike traditional one-way requirements flows, this system works in multiple directions to ensure documentation and code remain aligned.

## Core Philosophy

This system is built on several key principles:

- **State-based, not temporal**: Documents describe what IS, not what will be
- **Bidirectional flow**: Requirements → Code AND Code → Specifications  
- **Living documentation**: Specs evolve with code reality
- **Automatic processing**: Tools discover what needs doing
- **Evidence-based**: All claims backed by code
- **Focused documents**: Keep specifications concise and clear

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional documentation suffers from:
- **One-way flow**: Ideas → Requirements → Code → Outdated docs
- **Temporal decay**: Plans become wishes as reality diverges
- **Manual burden**: Updating docs is tedious and often skipped
- **Lost context**: Why decisions were made gets forgotten
- **Poor discoverability**: Hard to find what you need

This system addresses each of these issues through automation and bidirectional synchronization.

## Four Modes of Operation

The system operates in four distinct modes depending on your needs:

### Mode 1: New Project Development (Forward)
Start with an idea and develop specifications before code.

**When to use**: 
- Starting a greenfield project
- Planning major new features
- Prototyping new systems

**Process**:
1. Define system purpose (why build this?)
2. Document technical strategies (key decisions)
3. Design system architecture (component structure)
4. Specify component capabilities (what each does)
5. Detail implementation approach (how it works)
6. Implement following specifications

**Benefits**:
- Clear vision before coding
- Thoughtful design decisions
- Reduced rework
- Better team alignment

### Mode 2: Synchronized Updates (Bidirectional)
Keep specifications updated as code evolves.

**When to use**:
- During active development
- When making changes to existing features
- As part of your PR process

**Process**:
1. Make code changes
2. Run update prompt
3. Review suggested spec updates
4. Commit code and docs together

**Benefits**:
- Documentation stays current
- Changes are traceable
- Context is preserved
- Minimal manual effort

### Mode 3: Alignment Checking (Validation)
Detect and reconcile misalignments between specs and code.

**When to use**:
- Regular documentation health checks
- Before major refactoring
- During technical debt assessment
- Pre-release validation

**Process**:
1. Run alignment check
2. Review misalignment report
3. Prioritize fixes by severity
4. Update specs or code as needed

**Benefits**:
- Catches documentation drift
- Identifies undocumented changes
- Maintains quality standards
- Prevents technical debt

### Mode 4: Reverse Engineering (Backward)
Extract specifications from existing code.

**When to use**:
- Inheriting legacy systems
- Documenting undocumented code
- Creating baseline documentation
- Understanding existing systems

**Process**:
1. Point at codebase
2. Run extraction prompt
3. Review generated specs
4. Refine and clarify
5. Establish as baseline

**Benefits**:
- Quick documentation creation
- Captures actual behavior
- No guesswork needed
- Foundation for future updates

## Five Levels of Specification

The system uses a hierarchy of specifications, each serving different audiences and purposes:

### 1. System Purpose (WHY)
- **Audience**: Business stakeholders, product managers
- **Content**: Business value, user needs, success metrics
- **Files**: Single document in `1-purpose/`
- **Reversibility**: Partial (can infer what, harder to infer why)

### 2. Technical Strategy (WHAT decisions)
- **Audience**: Architects, tech leads
- **Content**: Key technical choices, patterns, trade-offs
- **Files**: Multiple documents in `2-strategy/`
- **Reversibility**: Partial (can see choices, may lose rationale)

### 3. System Design (HOW structured)
- **Audience**: Development teams
- **Content**: Architecture, component boundaries, interactions
- **Files**: Multiple documents in `3-design/`
- **Reversibility**: Full (architecture is observable)

### 4. Component Specifications (WHAT components do)
- **Audience**: Component developers
- **Content**: Capabilities, interfaces, behaviors
- **Files**: One per component in `4-components/`
- **Reversibility**: Full (behavior is testable)

### 5. Implementation Specifications (HOW it works)
- **Audience**: Implementers, maintainers
- **Content**: APIs, schemas, algorithms, deployment
- **Files**: One per component in `5-implementation/`
- **Reversibility**: Full (directly from code)

## Key Concepts

### Living Documentation
Documentation that evolves with your code, not a one-time artifact. Changes in code trigger documentation updates, and documentation changes inform code modifications.

### Bidirectional Flow
Information flows both ways:
- **Forward**: Ideas shape specifications which guide implementation
- **Backward**: Code reality updates specifications which clarify purpose

### State-Based Specifications
Documents describe the current state of the system, not future plans or historical decisions. Use version control for history and issue trackers for future work.

### Automatic Discovery
The system automatically:
- Finds files that need processing
- Detects whether to create or update
- Identifies components from architecture
- Tracks dependencies between levels

### Test-Driven Development Integration
The system emphasizes TDD throughout:
- Test strategies defined at component level
- Implementation plans include test-first approach
- Validation ensures test coverage before implementation
- Master plans coordinate testing across components

## How It Works

### For New Projects
1. Start with `1-write-purpose.md` to define why you're building
2. Progress through each level, letting each inform the next
3. Use `pre-implementation-validation.md` to ensure readiness
4. Execute with `5.3-implement-from-specs.md` following TDD practices

### For Existing Code
1. Use `extract-specs-from-code.md` to create initial documentation
2. Review and refine extracted specifications
3. Set up regular synchronization with `update-specs-with-code.md`
4. Run periodic checks with `align-specs-to-code.md`

### For Rapid Prototypes
1. Use `auto-build.md` for quick experiments
2. System fills gaps with reasonable assumptions
3. Review generated artifacts
4. Not for production use!

## Benefits Over Traditional Documentation

| Traditional | This System |
|------------|-------------|
| Gets outdated quickly | Stays synchronized |
| One-way flow | Bidirectional updates |
| Manual updates | Automated extraction |
| Wishes and plans | Current reality |
| Hard to maintain | Self-maintaining |
| Often ignored | Always relevant |

## When to Use This System

**Perfect for**:
- Projects needing maintained documentation
- Teams practicing continuous delivery
- Systems requiring compliance/audit trails
- Complex architectures needing clarity
- Legacy system modernization

**Not ideal for**:
- Throwaway prototypes
- Extremely simple scripts
- Projects with no documentation needs

## Next Steps

1. Review the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for detailed workflows
2. Understand the [Architecture](architecture.md) if extending the system
3. Try the [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) examples
4. Explore [example projects](examples/) for inspiration

Remember: The goal is documentation that helps you build and maintain better software, not documentation for its own sake. Start small, be consistent, and let the system help you maintain quality documentation that actually reflects reality.
