## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-01 - Initial Release

### Core Features
- **Four Modes of Operation**
  - Mode 1: Forward development (idea → code)
  - Mode 2: Synchronized updates
  - Mode 3: Alignment checking
  - Mode 4: Reverse engineering (code → docs)

- **Five Specification Levels**
  1. Purpose (WHY) - Business value and goals
  2. Strategy (WHAT) - Technical decisions
  3. Design (HOW) - System architecture
  4. Components (WHAT) - Component capabilities
  5. Implementation (HOW) - Technical details

- **Core Principles**
  - State-based documentation (what IS, not WILL BE)
  - Bidirectional information flow
  - Living documentation
  - Automatic discovery
  - Evidence-based specifications

### Initial Prompts
