### 2. Complexity Scoring

| Factor | Score (0-10) | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| AI/ML Complexity | X | 0.3 | X.X |
| Integration Complexity | X | 0.25 | X.X |
| Discovery Needs | X | 0.25 | X.X |
| Requirements Volatility | X | 0.2 | X.X |
| **Total** | | | **X.X** |

**Overall Complexity Level**:
- 0-2.5: Low - Traditional development appropriate
- 2.5-5.0: Medium - Some iteration expected
- 5.0-7.5: High - Significant exploration needed
- 7.5-10: Extreme - Highly exploratory approach required
