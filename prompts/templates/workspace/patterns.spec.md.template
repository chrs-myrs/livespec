# [PROJECT_NAME] Development Patterns

**Criticality**: IMPORTANT
**Failure Mode**: Inconsistent patterns make codebase harder to understand and maintain

## Specification

[Describe coding and specification patterns for this project. Examples:
- File naming conventions (kebab-case, .spec.md extension, etc.)
- Code organization patterns (feature folders, separation of concerns)
- Documentation standards (inline comments, README structure)
- Specification format (all specs follow MSL)
- Testing patterns (unit, integration, e2e structure)]

## Validation

- [File naming follows documented convention]
- [Code structure adheres to patterns]
- [Documentation matches standards]
- [All specs follow specified format]
- [Tests follow established patterns]
