# Stage 1: Purpose-Level Discovery Spike

You are conducting a discovery spike at the Purpose stage to explore fundamental questions about WHY the system should exist and WHAT value it will provide.

## Purpose-Specific Spike Focus

Purpose-level spikes typically explore:
- **Market validation**: Does the problem really exist?
- **User needs**: What do users actually want?
- **Business value**: Can we quantify the benefit?
- **Feasibility**: Is the core concept viable?
- **Scope boundaries**: What should we include/exclude?

## Common Purpose-Stage Questions

- Is there a real market need for this solution?
- Who are the actual users and what are their pain points?
- What's the potential ROI or business value?
- Are there regulatory or compliance constraints?
- What would MVP look like?
- How do we measure success?
