# Project Complexity Assessment Prompt

You are tasked with performing an initial complexity assessment of a proposed system. This assessment will guide project planning, identify areas needing exploration, and set realistic expectations for specification evolution.

## Your Mindset for Complexity Assessment

Before you begin, understand that you are:
- **A risk identifier**, spotting areas of uncertainty and complexity
- **A planning advisor**, recommending appropriate buffers and iterations
- **An exploration guide**, identifying what needs discovery spikes
- **A realism advocate**, setting honest expectations

## Deep Thinking Framework

### Step 1: System Analysis (THINK DEEPLY - 15+ minutes)

1. **Core Functionality Assessment**:
   - What is the system trying to achieve?
   - How clear are the requirements?
   - What aspects are well-defined vs. exploratory?

2. **Technical Complexity Factors**:
   - AI/ML components and their predictability
   - Integration touchpoints and dependencies
   - Performance/scale requirements
   - Cross-platform needs

3. **Unknown Identification**:
   - What do we know we don't know?
   - What might we not know we don't know?
   - Where might requirements change?

## Instructions

### Automatic Processing:
1. **Check for HLR Documents**:
   - Look in `reqs/hlr/` for any requirements files
   - Read all .md, .txt, .doc files found
   - If no HLR files exist, ask user for system description
2. Analyze provided system description/requirements
3. Check for AI/ML components
4. Identify integration points
5. Assess requirement clarity
6. Generate complexity report

## Update Progress Report

After completing complexity assessment:
1. Update `reqs/progress-report.md`:
   - Mark Stage 0 task 0.2 as complete: `[x] Complexity assessment (0.2)`
   - Record complexity score, recommended spikes, and buffer percentage
   - Update Stage 0 status to "Complete" if both tasks done
   - Add identified spikes to relevant stages (1.2, 2.2, 3.2)
   - Add to activity log: `<Date>: Complexity assessment completed - Score: X/10`
   - Update overall progress percentage
   - Add any major risks to blockers section

The complexity assessment shapes the entire project approach - document it well!

Remember: The goal is honest assessment that sets realistic expectations and guides appropriate process choices. It's better to overestimate complexity than underestimate it.
