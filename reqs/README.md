# Requirements & Specifications Structure

This folder contains living documentation that describes both the purpose and implementation of the system. Documents can be created forward (for new projects) or reverse-engineered from existing code.

## Folder Structure

- **1-purpose/** - System purpose and business value (single document)
- **2-strategy/** - Technical strategies and key decisions (multiple documents)
- **3-design/** - System architecture and component design (multiple documents)
- **4-components/** - Component specifications and capabilities (one per component)
- **5-implementation/** - Technical implementation details (one per component)

## Document Types

1. **System Purpose** - WHY the system exists and what business value it provides
2. **Technical Strategy** - Key technical decisions and patterns chosen
3. **System Design** - How components are structured and interact
4. **Component Specifications** - WHAT each component does (capabilities)
5. **Implementation Specifications** - HOW each component works (technical details)

## Key Principles

- Documents describe current state, not future plans
- All documents are bidirectionally maintainable
- Change logs track evolution over time
- Task lists are separate from specifications
