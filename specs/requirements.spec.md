# LiveSpec Requirements

**Criticality**: CRITICAL
**Failure Mode**: Without clear requirements, LiveSpec lacks cohesive direction and becomes disconnected collection of features

## Specification

LiveSpec must provide methodology for bidirectional specification-code synchronization, support AI-assisted development across any agent, work for both greenfield and brownfield projects, and maintain specifications without becoming maintenance burden.

## Core Requirements

1. **Bidirectional Synchronization** - Support spec-first (design) and code-first (extraction) workflows
2. **AI Agent Support** - Provide structured context enabling effective AI assistance
3. **Universal Applicability** - Work equally well for new projects and existing codebases
4. **Minimal Maintenance** - Specifications stay current without significant overhead
5. **Voluntary Adoption** - Developers maintain specs because they reduce cognitive load

## Validation

- Specifications remain synchronized throughout development lifecycle
- AI agents effectively use LiveSpec structure for development tasks
- Users successfully adopt for both new and existing projects
- Documentation stays current without enforcement mechanisms
- Developers report reduced maintenance burden compared to traditional documentation
