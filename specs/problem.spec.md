# LiveSpec Problem Statement

**Criticality**: CRITICAL
**Failure Mode**: Without clear problem definition, LiveSpec becomes solution looking for problem

## Specification

Software specifications and implementation inevitably drift apart over time. Without synchronization methodology, documentation becomes obsolete, AI agents lack accurate context, and maintenance burden increases until specifications are abandoned entirely.

## Validation

- Users recognize specification drift in their own projects
- LiveSpec methodology demonstrably reduces drift
- AI agents successfully use LiveSpec specifications for development
- Developers voluntarily maintain specifications without enforcement
- Specifications remain current throughout project lifecycle
