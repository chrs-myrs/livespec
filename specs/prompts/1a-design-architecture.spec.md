## Prompt Outputs

- `specs/architecture.spec.md` or equivalent - System structure and key design decisions

## Validation

- Architecture specification exists
- Follows MSL format
- Defines major components and boundaries
- Addresses problem statement
- Satisfies all constraints
- No implementation details (focuses on structure)
