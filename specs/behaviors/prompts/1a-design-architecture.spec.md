# Prompt Behavior: Design Architecture

## Requirements
- [!] Prompt guides AI agent to document high-level solution architecture defining major components and their interactions, focusing on WHAT not HOW.
  - Architecture specification exists
  - Follows MSL format
  - Defines major components and boundaries
  - Addresses problem statement
  - Satisfies all constraints
  - No implementation details (focuses on structure)

## Prompt Outputs

- `specs/strategy/architecture.spec.md` - System structure and key design decisions

## Validation

- Architecture specification exists
- Follows MSL format
- Defines major components and boundaries
- Addresses problem statement
- Satisfies all constraints
- No implementation details (focuses on structure)
