# LiveSpec Purpose

## Why LiveSpec Exists

Specifications inevitably drift from reality—code diverges from docs, policies lag behind practice, procedures become outdated. This drift makes documentation obsolete and prevents AI agents from providing effective assistance.

## What Success Looks Like

- Specifications remain synchronized with reality throughout evolution
- AI agents have structured context for effective assistance
- Documentation stays current without becoming a maintenance burden
- Works equally well for new projects and existing systems
- Teams adopt and maintain specifications voluntarily (choosing LiveSpec means accepting AI-guided methodology discipline)
- Applies across software development, governance, operations, and planning

## Specification Philosophy

LiveSpec treats everything as specifications—just at different abstraction levels. The numbered folders (1-requirements, 2-strategy, 3-behaviors) represent abstraction from strategic to detailed, not different document types. All use MSL format. Requirements are specifications; they specify strategic outcomes rather than implementation details.

## Primary Focus

**Software development** remains LiveSpec's primary domain, with proven applications in governance (policies, procedures), operations (runbooks, playbooks), and planning (requirements, workflows).
