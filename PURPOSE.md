# LiveSpec Purpose

## Why LiveSpec Exists

Specifications inevitably drift from realityâ€”code diverges from docs, policies lag behind practice, procedures become outdated. This drift makes documentation obsolete and prevents AI agents from providing effective assistance.

## What Success Looks Like

- Specifications remain synchronized with reality throughout evolution
- AI agents have structured context for effective assistance
- Documentation stays current without becoming a maintenance burden
- Works equally well for new projects and existing systems
- Teams adopt and maintain specifications voluntarily (choosing LiveSpec means accepting AI-guided methodology discipline)
- Applies across software development, governance, operations, and planning

## Primary Focus

**Software development** remains LiveSpec's primary domain, with proven applications in governance (policies, procedures), operations (runbooks, playbooks), and planning (requirements, workflows).
