# LiveSpec Purpose

## Why LiveSpec Exists

Software specifications and code inevitably drift apart, causing documentation to become obsolete and preventing AI agents from working effectively with existing codebases.

## What Success Looks Like

- Specifications remain synchronized with code throughout development
- AI agents have structured context for effective assistance
- Documentation stays current without becoming a maintenance burden
- Works equally well for new projects and existing codebases
- Developers adopt and maintain specifications voluntarily
