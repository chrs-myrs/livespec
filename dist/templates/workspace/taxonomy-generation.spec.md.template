# Project Taxonomy

## Requirements
- [!] This project is classified as GENERATION domain with explicit workspace scope and specs boundary to prevent organizational confusion.

  **Project Domain**: Generation
  - This project transforms source data (user-provided information) into tailored deliverables (generated documents, reports, PDFs)
  - Primary pattern: data/ → specs/ define transformations → [generated outputs]
  - Examples: CV generators, report builders, document templating systems

  **Workspace Scope** (portable methodology only):
  - ✅ workspace/constitution.spec.md - Development principles (portable)
  - ✅ workspace/patterns.spec.md - Naming and format conventions (portable)
  - ✅ workspace/workflows.spec.md - Development process (portable)
  - ✅ workspace/taxonomy.spec.md - This classification document (portable)
  - ❌ NOT workspace: Product-specific processes or workflows
    - Examples: "job-applications.spec.md", "career-research.spec.md", "report-generation-process.spec.md"
    - These define WHAT this project does (product behaviors), not HOW to build any project (methodology)
    - Correct location: specs/3-behaviors/processes/[domain]/ or specs/2-strategy/
    - Test: "Could I use this exact spec in a weather app?" → NO → Not workspace

  **Specs Boundary** (specifications only, no data):
  - specs/ contains ONLY .spec.md files defining observable system behavior
  - Source data lives OUTSIDE specs/:
    - User data → data/ folder (personal information, templates, source content)
    - Research notes → research/ folder (background research, findings, references)
    - Generated outputs → [location where generation scripts output, typically var/generated/ or generated/]
  - specs/ defines WHAT to do with data (transformation rules, generation behavior)
  - specs/ NEVER contains the actual data itself
  - Example: ✅ specs/3-behaviors/cv-generation.spec.md (defines HOW to generate CVs), ❌ specs/my-cv-details.yaml (actual data)

  **AI agents must**:
  - Check this taxonomy.spec.md FIRST before creating any files
  - Verify workspace/ additions pass portability test ("works in ANY project?" → YES = workspace)
  - Keep data, research, and generated outputs OUT of specs/
  - Place product-specific processes in specs/3-behaviors/processes/ or specs/2-strategy/, NOT workspace/
  - Update this taxonomy when project classification fundamentally changes

## Validation
- All workspace/ files are portable methodology (pass "any project" test)
- specs/ contains only .spec.md files (no data, research, or generated artifacts)
- Source data clearly separated from specifications
- Product behaviors placed in appropriate specs/ subdirectories, not workspace/
