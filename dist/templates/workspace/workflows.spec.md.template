# [PROJECT_NAME] Development Workflows

## Requirements
- [Describe development workflows for this project]

**Recommended workflows to consider:**

**Feature Development:**
1. Specification first (always - create .spec.md before implementation)
2. Implementation (follow spec, reference REQ-XXX)
3. Testing (validate against spec requirements)
4. Review and approval

**Bug Fix Workflow:**
1. Reproduce issue
2. Add regression test (if applicable)
3. Fix implementation
4. Verify fix passes tests
5. Update spec if behavior changed

**Spec-Code Sync:**
- Detect drift regularly (compare specs to implementation)
- Update specs when requirements change
- Validate implementation still satisfies specs
- Maintain bidirectional traceability

**Commit Workflow:**
- For AI commit guidance: See .livespec/guides/ai-commits.md (optional)
- Follow conventional commit format
- Create atomic, logical commits
- Reference specs/requirements in commit messages

**MCP Server Debugging (if applicable):**
1. Check log location (platform-specific, see specs/3-behaviors/dev-environment/mcp-integration.spec.md)
2. Identify server log (mcp-server-<name>.log)
3. Examine recent errors (tail -100 <log>)
4. Match error pattern (404, transport closed, ENOENT, auth failure)
5. Test components individually (file exists, command works, config valid)
6. Validate configuration (JSON syntax, paths, credentials)
7. Restart Claude Desktop cleanly

**Platform-Specific Patterns:**

*Windows with WSL:*
- Path format: `\\wsl.localhost\<Distribution>\<linux-path>`
- Config: `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- AWS: Static credentials only (no SSO)

*macOS/Linux:*
- Path format: Standard Unix paths
- Config: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` (macOS) or `~/.config/Claude/` (Linux)
- AWS: Static credentials only (no SSO)

**Validation:**
  - [Evidence workflow is followed (git history, PR patterns)]
  - [Completed work adheres to workflow steps]
  - [No steps skipped in critical workflows (especially spec-first)]
  - [Workflow produces expected artifacts]
  - [Team members follow documented process]
  - [MCP servers connect successfully (if applicable)]
  - [Debugging workflow resolves common issues (if applicable)]
