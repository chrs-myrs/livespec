# 4a: Detect Drift

**Phase**: EVOLVE
**Purpose**: Detect when code and specifications have diverged
**Context**: See `specs/3-behaviors/drift-detection.spec.md` for methodology

## Task

Identify semantic differences between specifications and implementation.

## When to Check for Drift

Run drift detection:
- **After code changes**: When implementation is modified
- **After spec changes**: When requirements are updated
- **Periodically**: Weekly or before releases
- **Before major work**: To ensure clean starting point

## Drift Detection Process

### 1. Identify Changes

**Since Last Check:**
```bash
# What code changed?
git log --since="last-check" --name-only src/

# What specs changed?
git log --since="last-check" --name-only specs/
```

**Focus Areas:**
- Files modified in implementation
- Related specification files
- Contract changes
- Test modifications

### 2. Semantic Analysis

For each changed area, use semantic understanding (not text diff):

**Tools to Consider:**
- **SemanticDiff**: Structural code comparison
- **oasdiff**: OpenAPI contract drift
- **Language-specific**: AST analyzers for your language

**Questions to Ask:**
- Did the behavior change or just the implementation?
- Are contracts still satisfied?
- Do tests still validate specs?
- Are there new behaviors not specified?

### 3. Classify Changes

Use the 70-80-10 pattern from `specs/3-behaviors/drift-detection.spec.md`:

#### Auto-Accept (70-80%)
Changes that DON'T affect specs:
- ✅ Refactoring (same behavior, different code)
- ✅ Formatting and style changes
- ✅ Performance optimizations (behavior unchanged)
- ✅ Internal implementation improvements
- ✅ Non-breaking additions

#### Review Needed (10-20%)
Changes that MIGHT affect specs:
- ⚠️ Behavior modifications
- ⚠️ New features added
- ⚠️ Contract changes
- ⚠️ Performance characteristic changes
- ⚠️ Error handling changes

#### Manual Resolution (5-10%)
Changes requiring human decision:
- 🔴 Breaking changes
- 🔴 Conflicting requirements
- 🔴 Removed features
- 🔴 Ambiguous intent
- 🔴 Multi-spec impacts

### 4. Trace Impact

When specifications change, trace dependencies to detect cascading effects:

**Check Frontmatter Dependencies:**
```bash
# What does this spec derive from?
grep -A 5 "^---" specs/changed-spec.spec.md | grep "derives_from\|constrained_by\|satisfies"

# What derives from this spec?
grep -r "derives_from.*$(basename $CHANGED_SPEC)" specs/
```

**Upward Trace (Validation):**

Verify the change still aligns with parent specs:

```markdown
Changed: specs/2-strategy/architecture.spec.md

Upward validation:
  ✓ Still satisfies PURPOSE.md goal
  ✓ Still respects specs/1-requirements/strategic/constraints.spec.md
  ⚠️ May not fully align with specs/1-requirements/strategic/outcomes.spec.md anymore

Action: Review outcomes.spec.md alignment
```

**Downward Trace (Propagation):**

Identify child specs that may need updates:

```markdown
Changed: specs/2-strategy/architecture.spec.md

Downward propagation:
  - specs/3-behaviors/prompts/0a-setup-workspace.spec.md (derives from architecture)
  - specs/3-behaviors/prompts/1a-design-architecture.spec.md (derives from architecture)
  - All prompts/*/  (implementation may need updates)

Action: Review each child spec for alignment
```

**Horizontal Trace (Process):**

Check if workspace specs need updates:

```markdown
Changed: specs/2-strategy/architecture.spec.md (now uses 6 phases instead of 5)

Horizontal impacts:
  - specs/workspace/workflows.spec.md (may reference 5-phase model)
  - specs/workspace/patterns.spec.md (folder structure may change)

Action: Update workspace specs to reflect new structure
```

**Common Impact Patterns:**

| Changed Spec | Upward Check | Downward Check |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **PURPOSE.md** | None (root) | 1-requirements/strategic/outcomes.spec.md, 1-requirements/strategic/constraints.spec.md |
| **1-requirements/strategic/outcomes.spec.md** | PURPOSE.md | 2-strategy/architecture.spec.md, all 3-behaviors/ |
| **1-requirements/strategic/constraints.spec.md** | PURPOSE.md | 2-strategy/architecture.spec.md, all 3-behaviors/ |
| **2-strategy/architecture.spec.md** | PURPOSE.md, 1-requirements/strategic/outcomes.spec.md, 1-requirements/strategic/constraints.spec.md | All prompts/, all 3-behaviors/ |
| **3-behaviors/*.spec.md** | 2-strategy/architecture.spec.md, 1-requirements/strategic/outcomes.spec.md | Code implementation |

**Detection Questions:**

1. **Does this change violate a constraint?**
   - Check all specs in `constrained_by` frontmatter
   - Validate against constraint validation criteria

2. **Does this change break parent alignment?**
   - Check all specs in `derives_from` frontmatter
   - Verify derivation still makes sense

3. **Do child specs need updates?**
   - Find all specs that derive from changed spec
   - Review each for continued alignment

4. **Is code now misaligned?**
   - If behavior spec changed, check implementation
   - If architecture changed, check structure

## Create Drift Report

Document findings in `drift-report.md`:

```markdown
# Drift Detection Report

**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Since**: 2025-01-03
**Status**: ✅ CLEAN | ⚠️ MINOR DRIFT | 🔴 MAJOR DRIFT

## Changes Detected

### Auto-Accepted (No Spec Changes)
- Refactored authentication module (same behavior)
- Updated dependencies
- Fixed formatting issues

### Requiring Review
1. **New behavior: Password reset via email**
   - **Code**: Added password reset endpoint
   - **Spec**: No specification exists
   - **Action**: Extract new spec (4b-extract-specs.md)

2. **Modified behavior: CSV export includes timestamps**
   - **Code**: Added timestamp column to CSV export
   - **Spec**: specs/3-behaviors/data-export.spec.md doesn't mention timestamps
   - **Action**: Update spec to include timestamp behavior

### Requiring Manual Resolution
1. **Conflicting change: API response format**
   - **Code**: Changed response from array to paginated object
   - **Spec**: specs/3-contracts/api/users-api.yaml specifies array
   - **Conflict**: Breaking change not documented
   - **Decision Needed**: Revert code or version API?

## Summary
- Auto-accepted: 15 changes
- Review needed: 2 changes
- Manual resolution: 1 change

## Next Steps
1. Extract spec for password reset (4b)
2. Update data-export spec for timestamps
3. Resolve API pagination conflict (stakeholder input)
```

## Decision Framework

When classifying changes, use three-way thinking:

**Base → Code → Spec:**
- **Base**: What was the original intent?
- **Code**: What does the implementation do now?
- **Spec**: What does the specification say?

**Resolution:**
- If code matches intent but spec unclear → Clarify spec
- If code diverged from intent → Fix code or update spec
- If both evolved independently → Merge or choose one

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] All code changes since last check reviewed
- [ ] All spec changes since last check reviewed
- [ ] Changes classified (auto-accept, review, manual)
- [ ] Drift report created
- [ ] Next actions identified

## Next Step

Once drift is detected and classified, proceed to:
- `4b-extract-specs.md` for new behaviors
- `4c-update-specs.md` for modified behaviors
