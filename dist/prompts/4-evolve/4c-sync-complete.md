# Prompt Behavior: Synchronisation Complete

**Purpose**: Confirm specs and code are synchronized

## Context

You're in Phase 4 (EVOLVE), maintaining alignment between specifications and code as the system evolves.

## Task

1. Prompt guides AI agent to verify all drift resolved, run validation, document evolution, and confirm synchronisation complete.

## Output

Produce drift report, updated specs, or synchronization confirmation.

## Validation

- All drift items from 4a resolved
- All tests passing
- All behaviors have current specifications
- Evolution logged with rationale
- Changes committed to version control

## Success Criteria

**This prompt succeeds when:**
- All requirements from spec are satisfied
- Output is actionable and immediately usable
- No ambiguity in what needs to be done
- Clear path from current state to desired state
