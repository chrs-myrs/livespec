# Prompt Behavior: Implement from Specifications

**Purpose**: Build features according to specifications

## Context

You're in Phase 2 (BUILD), implementing features based on existing specifications. All behaviors should already be specified.

## Task

1. Prompt guides AI agent to implement system by following specifications in priority order (CRITICAL first), respecting workspace patterns and constraints.

## Output

Produce working code or tests that satisfy specifications.

## Validation

- All CRITICAL behaviors implemented
- Implementation follows workspace patterns
- All constraints satisfied
- Code matches behavior specifications
- No features added beyond specifications

## Success Criteria

**This prompt succeeds when:**
- All requirements from spec are satisfied
- Output is actionable and immediately usable
- No ambiguity in what needs to be done
- Clear path from current state to desired state

---

**Criticality**: CRITICAL
**Failure Mode**: Implementation doesn't follow specifications
