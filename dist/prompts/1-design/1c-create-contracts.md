# Prompt Behavior: Create Contracts

**Purpose**: Define interfaces and data contracts

## Context

You're in Phase 1 (DESIGN), creating specifications that define what the system should do before any implementation begins.

## Task

Follow specification requirements.

## Output

Generate behavior or contract specifications following MSL format.

## Validation

- Contracts created for all external interfaces
- Uses standard formats (OpenAPI 3.0, JSON Schema draft-07, AsyncAPI 2.0)
- Contracts are machine-readable and validatable
- No internal implementation contracts created

## Success Criteria

**This prompt succeeds when:**
- All requirements from spec are satisfied
- Output is actionable and immediately usable
- No ambiguity in what needs to be done
- Clear path from current state to desired state

**Criticality**: IMPORTANT
**Failure Mode**: External interfaces lack formal specifications
