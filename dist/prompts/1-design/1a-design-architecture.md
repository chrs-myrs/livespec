# Prompt Behavior: Design Architecture

**Purpose**: Define system architecture and technical approach

## Context

You're in Phase 1 (DESIGN), creating specifications that define what the system should do before any implementation begins.

## Task

1. Prompt guides AI agent to document high-level solution architecture defining major components and their interactions, focusing on WHAT not HOW.

## Output

Generate behavior or contract specifications following MSL format.

## Validation

- Architecture specification exists
- Follows MSL format
- Defines major components and boundaries
- Addresses problem statement
- Satisfies all constraints
- No implementation details (focuses on structure)

## Success Criteria

**This prompt succeeds when:**
- All requirements from spec are satisfied
- Output is actionable and immediately usable
- No ambiguity in what needs to be done
- Clear path from current state to desired state

**Criticality**: CRITICAL
**Failure Mode**: Implementation lacks architectural guidance
