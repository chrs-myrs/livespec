# Refine Workspace

Use `dist/prompts/utils/reorganize-workspace.md`

**What this does:** Analyzes context usage patterns from 10-15 sessions to identify hot/warm/cold sections, proposes START/MIDDLE/END repositioning, identifies repeated content for extraction, and generates reorganization plan for optimal agent efficiency.

**When to use:** After 10+ sessions, when context feels bloated, signal-to-noise ratio below 40%, agents fetching too often, or AGENTS.md exceeds compression level targets.
