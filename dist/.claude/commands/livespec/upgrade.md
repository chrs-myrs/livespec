# Upgrade LiveSpec

Use `dist/prompts/utils/upgrade-methodology.md`

**What this does:** Migrates project to new LiveSpec version by comparing current .livespec/ against new dist/, identifying breaking changes, updating workspace specs if needed, regenerating AGENTS.md, and validating after upgrade. Preserves project customizations while adopting new methodology improvements.

**When to use:** When new LiveSpec version released, when .livespec-version indicates outdated methodology, when wanting new features/improvements, or when instructed by LiveSpec maintainers.
