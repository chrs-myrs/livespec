# Audit Project

Run quality audits on LiveSpec project specifications.

**What this does:** Executes audit prompts based on type parameter, checking specifications for quality issues including over-specification, context compression effectiveness, spec coverage completeness, workspace bloat, and scope appropriateness.

**When to use:** Monthly reviews, before releases, when specs feel bloated, when investigating project health issues, or as part of quality assurance process.

**Parameters:**
- `type`: Audit type to run (minimalism, context, coverage, workspace-specs, workspace-scope, all)
  - `minimalism` - Check specs for over-specification using MSL principles (4 essential questions)
  - `context` - Analyze context compression effectiveness (AGENTS.md size, extraction ratio)
  - `coverage` - Verify all permanent files have specifications (uses check-requires-spec.sh)
  - `workspace-specs` - Detect bloat/redundancy in workspace specs
  - `workspace-scope` - Verify workspace scope appropriateness (portable vs product-specific)
  - `all` (default) - Run all 5 audit types sequentially, aggregate results

**Router logic:**
- `minimalism` → Use `dist/prompts/utils/audit-msl-minimalism.md`
- `context` → Use `dist/prompts/utils/audit-context-compression.md`
- `coverage` → Use `dist/prompts/utils/audit-spec-coverage.md`
- `workspace-specs` → Use `dist/prompts/utils/audit-workspace-specs.md`
- `workspace-scope` → Use `dist/prompts/utils/audit-workspace-scope.md`
- `all` → Execute all 5 prompts in sequence, aggregate results

**Examples:**
- `/livespec/audit` - Run all audits
- `/livespec/audit minimalism` - Check MSL compliance only
- `/livespec/audit coverage` - Verify spec coverage only
