# Rebuild Context

Use `dist/prompts/4-evolve/4d-regenerate-context.md`

**What this does:** Regenerates AGENTS.md and ctxt/ tree from workspace specifications (constitution, patterns, workflows, taxonomy), incorporating project-specific context while preserving generic LiveSpec methodology.

**When to use:** After updating workspace specs (specs/workspace/), after Phase 0 setup, when agent context feels stale, or when workspace changes need to propagate to agent guidance.
