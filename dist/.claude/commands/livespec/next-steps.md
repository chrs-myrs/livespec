# Next Steps

Use `dist/prompts/utils/next-steps.md`

**What this does:** Analyzes project state (what exists in specs/, what's implemented) to recommend appropriate next phase prompt. Provides workflow navigation showing where you are in the five-phase methodology (DEFINE → DESIGN → BUILD → VERIFY → EVOLVE) and what to do next.

**When to use:** When uncertain about next phase, after completing current phase, when returning to project after break, when project feels directionless, or when learning LiveSpec workflow.
