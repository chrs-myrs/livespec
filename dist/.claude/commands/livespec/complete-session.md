# Complete Session

Use `dist/prompts/utils/complete-session.md`

**What this does:** Analyzes current session for compliance with spec-first protocol and focus efficiency, captures learnings (corrections, clarifications, patterns, needed spec updates), and saves quantitative/qualitative data globally for methodology improvement.

**When to use:** At session end when context exceeds 100K tokens, all tasks complete, natural stopping point reached, or user appears stuck after multiple failed attempts.
