# Health Report

Use `dist/prompts/utils/run-health-report.md`

**What this does:** Runs 8 validation scripts (taxonomy, workspace scope, spec purity, architecture alignment, cross-references, generated files, versions, spec coverage), calculates health scores, assigns 🟢🟡🔴 status per category, and generates remediation plan for any issues detected.

**When to use:** Monthly health checks, before releases, when project feels unstable, after major changes, or when onboarding new contributors to show project standards.
