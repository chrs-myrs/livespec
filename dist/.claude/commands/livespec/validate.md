# Validate Project

Use `dist/prompts/utils/validate-project.md`

**What this does:** Runs comprehensive project validation including structural checks (taxonomy, workspace scope, spec purity), cross-reference integrity, generated file protection, version synchronization, and slash command sync. Reports errors (must fix) and warnings (should fix).

**When to use:** Before committing changes, after regenerating files (AGENTS.md, documentation), after updating specs, periodically (weekly/sprint end), before releases, or after pre-commit hook failures.
