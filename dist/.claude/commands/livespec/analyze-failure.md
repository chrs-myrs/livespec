# Analyze Failure

Use `dist/prompts/utils/analyze-failure.md`

**What this does:** Conducts forensic analysis when LiveSpec adoption fails or stalls. Investigates root causes (wrong project fit, insufficient buy-in, spec-first violations, workflow misalignment), documents failure mode in specs/failure-analysis.md, and provides recommendations for recovery or graceful exit.

**When to use:** When team abandoning LiveSpec, specs drifting despite methodology, compliance consistently below 50%, repeated spec-first violations, or considering whether to continue with LiveSpec.
