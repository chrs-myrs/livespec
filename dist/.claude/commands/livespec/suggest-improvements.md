# Suggest Improvements

Use `dist/prompts/utils/suggest-improvements.md` with parameters: {{scope}}

**What this does:** Analyzes accumulated feedback data from ~/.claude/livespec/ (compliance trends, session feedback) and registries (gaps, issues, improvements) to provide prioritized improvement recommendations based on impact × frequency scoring.

**When to use:** Monthly reviews, after multiple sessions accumulated, when methodology feels suboptimal, before planning methodology changes, or when investigating recurring issues.

**Parameters:**
- `scope`: Limit analysis to specific area (all, context, registries, validation)
  - `all` (default) - Full analysis across all areas
  - `context` - Context efficiency only (AGENTS.md size, compression effectiveness)
  - `registries` - Registry health only (gaps, issues, improvements tracking)
  - `validation` - Validation pass rates only (compliance trends, common failures)

**Examples:**
- `/livespec/suggest-improvements` - Full analysis
- `/livespec/suggest-improvements context` - Context efficiency only
