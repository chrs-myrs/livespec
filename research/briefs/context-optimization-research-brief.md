# AI Context Optimization Research Brief

## Executive Summary

This research investigates how AI coding agents consume and utilize context to inform LiveSpec v2's workspace/deliverable split architecture. The critical question: does separating persistent rules (workspace) from dynamic task specs (deliverable) actually improve AI performance?

## Research Motivation

**Problem**: LiveSpec v2 proposes splitting specifications into:
- **Workspace specs**: Persistent development environment rules (HOW we build)
- **Deliverable specs**: Dynamic task-specific requirements (WHAT we build)

**Assumption**: This separation will improve AI agent effectiveness by providing focused, relevant context.

**Risk**: If this assumption is wrong, the entire v2 architecture fails.

## Primary Research Questions

### Critical Questions (Must Answer)
1. **Does layered context improve AI output quality?**
   - Persistent rules + dynamic specs vs everything mixed
   - Measurable improvement percentage needed to justify complexity

2. **What's the optimal context structure for different agents?**
   - Claude (200K tokens), Copilot (8K), Cursor (50K), Gemini (1M+)
   - How does structure change with context window size?

3. **What's the performance cost of dynamic context generation?**
   - Acceptable latency thresholds (<100ms? <500ms?)
   - Memory overhead for file watching and regeneration

### Important Questions (Should Answer)
4. **How do AI agents prioritize context information?**
   - First-token bias vs recency bias vs semantic relevance
   - Does position in context matter?

5. **What's the relationship between context size and output quality?**
   - Diminishing returns curve
   - Optimal context size per agent type

6. **What are proven patterns for context organization?**
   - Hierarchical vs flat
   - Markdown sections vs separate files
   - Explicit vs implicit structure
