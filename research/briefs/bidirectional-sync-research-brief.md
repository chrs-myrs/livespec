# Bidirectional Synchronization & Conflict Resolution Research Brief

## Executive Summary

This research investigates proven patterns for maintaining bidirectional synchronization between code and specifications, with focus on conflict detection and resolution strategies. The critical challenge: how to keep specs and code synchronized when changes happen in both directions simultaneously.

## Research Motivation

**Problem**: LiveSpec v2's core innovation is bidirectional sync:
- **Forward**: Specs → Code (AI generates implementation from specs)
- **Reverse**: Code → Specs (Extract specifications from code changes)
- **Continuous**: Detect when specs and code diverge

**Challenge**: When code changes conflict with specs:
- Which is the source of truth?
- How do we detect semantic vs syntactic drift?
- How do we resolve conflicts without human intervention?
- What's the UX for presenting conflicts?

**Risk**: Without robust conflict resolution, bidirectional sync creates chaos instead of clarity.

## Primary Research Questions

### Critical Questions (Must Answer)
1. **What are proven patterns for bidirectional synchronization?**
   - How do production systems handle two-way sync?
   - What conflict detection strategies work at scale?

2. **How do you resolve spec/code conflicts automatically?**
   - Decision hierarchies (code wins vs spec wins vs merge)
   - Semantic change detection
   - Confidence scoring for automated resolution

3. **What makes a good conflict resolution UX?**
   - How to present conflicts clearly
   - What information helps users decide
   - Patterns that minimize cognitive load

### Important Questions (Should Answer)
4. **How do you detect meaningful drift vs noise?**
   - Semantic equivalence detection
   - Refactoring vs requirement changes
   - Confidence thresholds

5. **What's the performance cost of continuous sync?**
   - File watching overhead
   - Diff computation at scale
   - Real-time vs batch sync tradeoffs

6. **How do you handle partial implementations?**
   - Specs exist but code incomplete
   - Code exists but specs not updated
   - Work-in-progress states

## Red Flags

Watch for evidence that:
- **No system successfully does bidirectional sync** at scale
- **Conflict resolution requires too much human intervention**
- **Performance overhead makes continuous sync impractical**
- **Semantic drift detection is unsolved**
- **User experience is universally poor**

If multiple red flags appear, bidirectional sync may need to be scope-reduced or approached differently.

## Integration with Context Research

This research complements the context optimization brief:
- **Context research**: Does splitting specs improve AI output?
- **This research**: How to keep split specs synchronized with code?

Both must succeed for LiveSpec v2 to work. Findings should inform:
- What metadata helps conflict resolution
- How context affects drift detection
- Whether workspace/deliverable split affects sync complexity
