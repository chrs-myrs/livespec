This folder contains archived versions of LiveSpec.

## v1-2025-01 (LiveSpec v1)

LiveSpec v1 was the initial version with 7+ stages and complex orchestration.

**Archived on**: 2025-01-10
**Reason**: Rebuilt as v2 with simplified 5-phase structure

**Contents:**
- `prompts/`: Original 7-stage prompts
- `docs/`: v1 documentation
- `reqs/`: v1 specification structure

**Why v2:**
- Reduced from 7+ stages to 5 phases (cognitive load)
- Simplified specs/deliverable/ to flat specs/ structure
- Focused on information architecture, not AI tooling
- Adopted MSL minimalism throughout
- Clearer workspace/product separation

**Still Relevant:**
- `plan/`: Analysis and research informing v2
- `research/`: Research reports on context optimization and sync patterns
