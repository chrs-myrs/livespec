# System Purpose

**System Name**: Payment Processing System
**Document Status**: Current
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-10
**Source**: Code analysis and stakeholder interviews

## Executive Summary

The Payment Processing System handles online payment transactions for the e-commerce platform, supporting multiple payment providers with automatic failover, fraud detection, and PCI compliance features. *Inferred: The system was built to reduce payment failures and fraud losses while maintaining compliance.*

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
*Inferred from code patterns and database schema:*
- System handles ~10,000 transactions daily across 3 payment providers
- Complex retry logic suggests previous issues with payment failures
- Extensive audit logging indicates compliance requirements
- Fraud detection module shows history of fraudulent transactions

### Business Value
*Inferred from functionality:*
- **Payment Success**: Retry logic and provider failover maximize successful transactions
- **Fraud Prevention**: ML-based detection reduces chargebacks
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS compliance features protect business from penalties
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures

*Note: Specific metrics unavailable - no documentation found*

### Strategic Alignment
*Unknown - no business strategy documentation found*

## System Scope

### Included Capabilities (Observed)
- Payment processing for Stripe, PayPal, and Square
- Automatic failover between providers
- Fraud detection using ML model
- Payment retry with exponential backoff
- PCI-compliant card tokenization
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Webhook handling for async updates
- Refund and partial refund processing
- Currency conversion (10 currencies found)
- Rate limiting per merchant

### Excluded Capabilities
*Inferred from missing functionality:*
- Subscription billing (no recurring payment code)
- Physical card processing (online only)
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Buy-now-pay-later options

## Users and Stakeholders

### Primary Users
*Inferred from API endpoints and logs:*
- **E-commerce Platform**: Initiates payment requests
- **Admin Portal**: Reviews transactions and handles refunds
- **Webhook Services**: Payment provider callbacks

### Key Stakeholders
*Unknown - need stakeholder interviews*

## Success Metrics

### Observed Metrics (from logs and monitoring)
- Payment success rate tracking (target unknown)
- Average processing time: <3 seconds
- Fraud detection rate monitoring
- Provider availability tracking
- API response times by endpoint

### Business Metrics
*Unknown - no business KPIs documented*

## Constraints and Compliance

### Observed Compliance Features
- PCI DSS compliance:
  - No card storage (tokenization only)
  - Encrypted transmission
  - Access logging
  - Network segmentation code
- GDPR considerations:
  - Data retention policies (90 days)
  - Audit trail anonymization

### Technical Constraints (Inferred)
- Must maintain <3 second response time
- Database connection pool limited to 50
- Rate limits: 100 requests/second per merchant
- Webhook timeout: 10 seconds

## Privacy and Security

### Data Classification
- **PII Handled**: Yes (names, addresses, email)
- **Card Data**: Tokenized only, never stored
- **Retention**: 90 days operational, 7 years audit logs

### Security Implementation (Observed)
- TLS 1.2+ for all external communications
- API key authentication with HMAC signatures
- IP allowlisting for admin functions
- Encrypted database fields for sensitive data

## Integration Points

### External Systems (Discovered)
- **Stripe API**: Primary payment provider (60% volume)
- **PayPal API**: Secondary provider (30% volume)
- **Square API**: Tertiary provider (10% volume)
- **Fraud Detection Service**: Real-time scoring (vendor unknown)
- **Email Service**: Transaction receipts
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Event streaming

### Dependencies
*Inferred from configuration and imports:*
- PostgreSQL database (primary data store)
- Redis (caching and rate limiting)
- RabbitMQ (async job processing)
- S3 (document storage)

## Assumptions and Risks

### Discovered Technical Debt
- **Risk**: Fraud detection model hasn't been updated in 18 months
- **Risk**: PayPal integration using deprecated API version
- **Risk**: No tests for currency conversion edge cases
- **Risk**: Hardcoded configuration in several places

### Operational Assumptions
*Based on code patterns:*
- Assumes reliable internet connectivity
- Expects <100ms database response times
- Requires all 3 payment providers to be configured

## Future Considerations

### Code Indicators of Future Plans
- Commented code for cryptocurrency support
- Database migrations for subscription fields (unused)
- Placeholder for European payment methods
- A/B testing framework (partially implemented)

### Maintenance Concerns
- Several deprecated dependencies
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed sync/async processing models
- No clear module boundaries
