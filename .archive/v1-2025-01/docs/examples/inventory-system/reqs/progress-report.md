## Key Decisions & Blockers

### Decisions Made
1. 2024-01-04: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance
2. 2024-01-04: REST over GraphQL for simplicity
3. 2024-01-05: Kubernetes deployment for scaling
4. 2024-01-07: Redis for real-time inventory cache
5. 2024-01-11: Event sourcing for audit trail

### Active Blockers
1. **Offline Operation Strategy**
   - Stage Affected: Stage 5
   - Description: Need approach for warehouses with poor connectivity
   - Action Needed: Spike to test offline-first architecture

### Resolved Blockers
1. 2024-01-10: SOX requirements clarified - Need immutable audit log
2. 2024-01-15: Real-time sync validated - Redis pub/sub works
