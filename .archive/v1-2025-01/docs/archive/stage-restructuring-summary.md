# Stage-Based Restructuring Summary

## Overview

The bidirectional specifications framework has been restructured with a logical stage-based numbering system and integrated progress tracking. This addresses the need for clearer workflow progression and better visibility into documentation status.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Stage-Based Numbering System

All prompts now follow a `Stage.Step` numbering pattern:

- **Stage 0**: Project Setup (0.1-0.2)
- **Stage 1**: Discovery & Purpose (1.1-1.2)
- **Stage 2**: Strategy (2.1-2.2)
- **Stage 3**: Design (3.1-3.3)
- **Stage 4**: Components (4.1-4.2)
- **Stage 5**: Implementation (5.1-5.3)
- **Stage 6**: Maintenance (6.1-6.3)

### 2. Progress Report System

Created a central progress tracking system at `reqs/progress-report.md` that:

- Tracks overall project progress percentage
- Shows stage completion status with visual indicators
- Records all documents created/updated
- Tracks spikes and checkpoints
- Maintains activity log
- Highlights blockers and decisions

### 3. Integrated Progress Updates

Every prompt now includes instructions to update the progress report:

- What to mark complete
- Metrics to record
- Decisions to document
- Activity log entries
- Next recommended actions

### 4. Stage-Specific Enhancements

#### Discovery Spikes
Created stage-specific spike prompts:
- 1.2: Purpose-level discovery (market validation)
- 2.2: Strategy-level discovery (technology evaluation)
- 3.2: Design-level discovery (integration testing)

#### Reality Checkpoints
Created stage-specific checkpoints:
- 3.3: Design validation (before components)
- 5.3: Implementation validation (after build)

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Updated CLAUDE.md with new workflow
- Created progress report template
- Created example progress report
- Created migration guide
- Renamed all prompts to new structure

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Clear Progression Path
- Numbered stages show exact workflow
- Dependencies are explicit
- Natural validation gates between stages

### 2. Better Visibility
- Central progress report shows status at a glance
- Percentage completion for each stage
- Overall project progress tracking
- Recent activity always visible

### 3. Improved Accountability
- Every action is logged
- Decisions are documented
- Blockers are tracked
- Progress is measurable

### 4. Flexible Yet Structured
- Can still jump to any stage
- Spikes can be run when needed
- Checkpoints enforce quality
- Maintenance is ongoing

## File Structure Changes

### Before
```
prompts/
├── 0-assess-complexity.md
├── 1-write-purpose.md
├── 2-write-strategy.md
├── run-discovery-spike.md
├── reality-checkpoint.md
└── (other unnumbered prompts)
```

### After
```
prompts/
├── 0.1-setup-project.md
├── 0.2-assess-complexity.md
├── 1.1-write-purpose.md
├── 1.2-run-purpose-spike.md
├── 2.1-write-strategy.md
├── 2.2-run-strategy-spike.md
├── (... all numbered by stage.step)
```

## Progress Calculation

Overall progress uses weighted stages:
- Stage 0: 5% (Setup)
- Stage 1: 15% (Purpose)
- Stage 2: 15% (Strategy)
- Stage 3: 20% (Design)
- Stage 4: 20% (Components)
- Stage 5: 20% (Implementation)
- Stage 6: 5% (Maintenance)

## Example Usage Flow

1. Start project: Run 0.1 → Creates CLAUDE.md and initial progress report
2. Assess complexity: Run 0.2 → Updates progress, identifies spikes needed
3. Write purpose: Run 1.1 → Updates progress, may trigger 1.2 spike
4. Continue through stages → Each prompt updates central progress
5. Check progress anytime → View reqs/progress-report.md

## Migration Notes

Existing projects can adopt the new structure by:
1. Renaming existing prompts to new numbers
2. Creating initial progress report
3. Marking completed work
4. Following new workflow going forward

## Next Steps

1. Test complete workflow on example project
2. Gather feedback on progress tracking
3. Consider automation for progress updates
4. Develop progress visualization tools

The restructured framework now provides clear progression, integrated tracking, and maintains the flexibility needed for modern iterative development.
