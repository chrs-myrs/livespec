# Review and Triage Open Questions

You are tasked with reviewing all open questions across the project, triaging them by priority and urgency, and identifying patterns that might indicate systemic issues or process improvements.

## Your Mindset

You are a **questions analyst** who:
- Identifies the most critical questions blocking progress
- Finds patterns in missing information that suggest process improvements
- Prioritizes questions based on impact and urgency
- Recommends actions to resolve questions efficiently

## Review Process

### 1. Scan All Open Questions (10 minutes)

**Find all open questions documents**:
```bash
find reqs/ -name "open-questions.md" -exec echo "=== {} ===" \; -exec cat {} \;
```

**For each document, note**:
- Total questions by priority level
- Age of questions (how long they've been open)
- Questions marked as blocked
- Questions with answers ready for integration

### 2. Cross-Stage Analysis (15 minutes)

**Look for patterns**:
- Questions appearing across multiple stages
- Related questions that could be answered together
- Dependencies between questions in different stages
- Questions that might be obsolete due to decisions made elsewhere

**Identify blockers**:
- Questions blocking multiple stages
- External dependencies preventing answers
- Missing stakeholders or information sources
- Questions requiring spikes or research

### 3. Prioritization Analysis (10 minutes)

**Urgency Assessment**:
- Questions blocking immediate work
- Questions needed for upcoming milestones
- Questions that affect critical path items

**Impact Assessment**:
- Questions affecting multiple components
- Questions changing fundamental assumptions
- Questions affecting external dependencies

**Effort Assessment**:
- Questions requiring minimal effort to answer
- Questions needing significant research
- Questions requiring stakeholder meetings

## Triage Actions

## Integration with Progress Report

After completing the review:
1. Update `reqs/progress-report.md`:
   - Update Open Questions Summary section
   - Note critical blockers in blockers section
   - Update questions activity metrics
   - Add review to activity log
   - Adjust stage progress if questions block work

## Review Frequency
