# LiveSpec v2

**Specifications that live with your code**

A folder structure and methodology for keeping specifications and code synchronized throughout the development lifecycle. Works with any AI coding agent.

## What is LiveSpec?

LiveSpec is three things:

1. **A folder structure** - Separates workspace (HOW you build) from product (WHAT you build)
2. **MSL specification format** - Markdown Specification Language keeps specs small and maintainable
3. **Five-phase methodology** - DEFINE â†’ DESIGN â†’ BUILD â†’ VERIFY â†’ EVOLVE

**Not a framework. Not a tool. Just information architecture.**

**This repository is a live example:** LiveSpec applied to a non-coding project (itself). See `specs/` for how we specify documentation, prompts, and methodology without writing code.

## The Problem

Software specifications and code inevitably drift apart. Documentation becomes obsolete. AI agents lack structured context for existing codebases. Manual sync is tedious and often skipped.

**LiveSpec solves this through:**
- Bidirectional synchronization (spec-first OR code-first workflows)
- Minimal specifications (MSL format - just what's essential)
- Continuous evolution (Phase 4 keeps specs and code aligned)
- AI-agent friendly structure (clear context, consistent format)

## Architecture

**Note:** This shows initial project setup flow. LiveSpec methodology is iterative - Phase 4 (EVOLVE) maintains continuous bidirectional sync between specs and code. See [Five Phases](#the-five-phases) for the complete cycle.

## Self-Documenting Framework

**Note:** This diagram shows how LiveSpec documents *itself* using its own methodology (dogfooding). The Architecture diagram above shows how *you* structure your project.

LiveSpec achieves complete circularity - every deliverable is defined by a spec, every spec is defined by the framework:

```mermaid
graph TD
    META[Framework<br/>7 metaspecs + 3 conventions]
    SPECS[Project Specs<br/>30 specifications]
    DELIVER[Deliverables<br/>Prompts, docs, framework, templates]

    META -->|constrain| SPECS
    SPECS -->|define| DELIVER
    DELIVER -.dogfoods.-> META

    style META fill:#fff4e1
    style SPECS fill:#e8f5e9
    style DELIVER fill:#fce4ec
```

**Complete chain verified:**
- Framework extends [MSL Standard](https://github.com/chrs-myrs/msl-specification) via base.spec.md
- Every spec has `governed-by:` pointing to a metaspec
- Every deliverable has a spec in `specs/` describing it
- LiveSpec dogfoods itself: the framework is specified using the framework

## AI-Powered Development

**LiveSpec enables AI agents to generate code from your specifications:**

Write minimal specs describing what your system should do. AI agents read these specs and generate the implementation. No framework lock-in - works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any coding agent.

**Spec-to-code generation:**
1. **Phase 1-2**: Write behavior specs â†’ AI generates code from specs
2. **Phase 4**: Code changes â†’ AI extracts specs from code
3. **Continuous**: Bidirectional sync keeps specs and code aligned

**Key difference from other tools:**
- **No CLI required** - Just copy folders, paste prompts to your AI agent
- **Agent-agnostic** - Same methodology works across Claude, Copilot, Cursor
- **Bidirectional** - Start with specs OR start with code (both work)
- **Zero dependencies** - Pure markdown files in standard folders

Compare to spec-kit: LiveSpec is the no-tooling, agent-agnostic alternative. Same philosophy (specs drive development) but manual-friendly and framework-free.

## Quick Start

### New Project (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone LiveSpec
git clone https://github.com/chrs-myrs/livespec.git
cd your-project

# Copy methodology to .livespec/ folder
cp -r livespec/dist/* .livespec

# Create specs structure
mkdir -p specs/workspace specs/behaviors specs/contracts

# Start Phase 0
claude-code "Use .livespec/0-define/0a-setup-workspace.md"
```

### Existing Project

```bash
# Copy methodology
cp -r livespec/dist/* .livespec

# Create structure
mkdir -p specs/workspace specs/behaviors specs/contracts

# Extract specifications from code
claude-code "Use .livespec/4-evolve/4b-extract-specs.md to document this codebase"
```

### Using Context7

```bash
# Just create structure
mkdir -p specs/workspace specs/behaviors specs/contracts

# Tell your AI agent:
# "Use @context7/chrs-myrs/livespec methodology"
# AI reads prompts remotely, helps create your specs
```

```

## MSL Format

All specifications follow [Markdown Specification Language (MSL)](https://github.com/chrs-myrs/msl-specification):

```markdown
---
criticality: CRITICAL
failure_mode: System unsecured without authentication
---

# User Authentication

## Requirements
- [!] System authenticates users via email and password before allowing access to protected resources.
  - Valid credentials allow login
  - Invalid credentials rejected
  - Sessions persist after authentication
  - Protected resources require authentication
```

**That's it.** Title, frontmatter, Requirements. Minimal. Testable.

## The Five Phases

LiveSpec guides development through five phases with clear entry/exit criteria. **Hybrid workflow** - natural progression through phases with feedback loops when discovering unknowns.

### Phase 0: DEFINE
Establish problem space and development approach
- Define problem statement
- Identify constraints
- Setup workspace specifications

### Phase 1: DESIGN
Design solution architecture
- Define architecture
- Specify behaviors
- Create contracts

### Phase 2: BUILD
Implement the solution
- Build to specifications
- Create tests
- Validate implementation

### Phase 3: VERIFY
Validate solution meets requirements
- Run validation
- Acceptance review
- Document results

### Phase 4: EVOLVE
Keep specs and code synchronized (continuous)
- Detect drift
- Extract new specs
- Update existing specs

### Continuous Evolution Cycle

Phase 4 maintains bidirectional sync - the core value of LiveSpec:

```mermaid
graph LR
    CODE[Code Changes]
    SPECS[Specifications]
    DRIFT[Detect Drift]
    UPDATE[Update/Extract]

    CODE -->|4a: detect-drift| DRIFT
    DRIFT -->|drift found| UPDATE
    UPDATE -->|4b: extract-specs<br/>4e: validate| SPECS
    SPECS -->|guide| CODE

    SPECS -.Phase 1-2<br/>Design & Build.-> CODE
    CODE -.Phase 4<br/>Evolve.-> SPECS

    style CODE fill:#e8f5e9
    style SPECS fill:#e8f5e9
    style DRIFT fill:#fff4e1
    style UPDATE fill:#fff4e1
```

**Key insight:** Specs and code inform each other continuously. Start with specs (design-first) OR start with code (extract-first) - both work.
