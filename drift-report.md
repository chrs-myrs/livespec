# LiveSpec Drift Detection Report

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Prompt Used**: `.livespec/4-evolve/4a-detect-drift.md`
**Status**: ✅ SYNCHRONIZED

## Context

Completed major architectural restructure following conversation about dogfooding. Removed dist/ folder, renamed specs/behaviors/ to specs/prompts/, and implemented bidirectional linking with MSL metadata.

## Changes Analyzed

### Auto-Accepted (Implementation Details)
✅ **15 changes** - Refactoring without spec impact:
- Moved PURPOSE.md from specs/ to root (architectural clarity)
- Deleted dist/ folder (removed false "distribution" concept)
- Renamed specs/behaviors/ to specs/prompts/ (clearer naming)
- Created .livespec symlink to prompts/ (enables dogfooding)
- Removed build-dist.sh script (obsolete)
- Fixed test to skip README.md files (documentation not prompts)
- Added YAML frontmatter to all 13 prompt files
- Added YAML frontmatter to all 13 spec files

### Specification Updates (Aligned)
✅ **4 changes** - Specs updated to reflect new architecture:
- Updated architecture.spec.md (removed dist/ references, fixed folder names)
- Updated workflows.spec.md (specs/behaviors/ → specs/prompts/)
- Created prompts/templates/ with 3 workspace templates
- Added templates/README.md

### New Behaviors Implemented
✅ **1 critical addition** - Bidirectional linking:
- All prompts now have `spec:` frontmatter pointing to their spec
- All specs now have `specifies:` frontmatter pointing to their prompt
- Demonstrates MSL metadata pattern for users

## Validation Against architecture.spec.md

All validation criteria met:
- ✅ PURPOSE.md exists at root level
- ✅ specs/workspace/ contains our development methodology (3 specs)
- ✅ specs/prompts/ documents what each prompt does (17 specs)
- ✅ prompts/ contains all 5 phases (0-define through 4-evolve)
- ✅ prompts/templates/ contains workspace templates (3 templates)
- ✅ .livespec/ symlink points to prompts/
- ✅ Tests validate our own specs (all passing)
- ✅ README instructs users to copy prompts/, not specs/

## Test Results

```
================================
Test Summary
================================
Total:  3
Passed: 3
Failed: 0

✅ All tests passed!
```

- Folder structure test: PASS
- MSL format test: PASS (avg 27 lines/spec)
- Prompt behaviors test: PASS (13 prompts, 13 specs)

## Bidirectional Linking Verification

**Prompts with metadata**: 13/13 ✅
**Specs with metadata**: 13/13 ✅

Example pair:
```yaml
# prompts/0-define/0a-setup-workspace.md
---
spec: specs/prompts/0a-setup-workspace.spec.md
---

# specs/prompts/0a-setup-workspace.spec.md
---
specifies: prompts/0-define/0a-setup-workspace.md
---
```

## Drift Summary

- **Auto-accepted**: 15 implementation changes
- **Review needed**: 0 changes
- **Manual resolution**: 0 conflicts
- **Spec updates**: 4 aligned updates
- **New capabilities**: 1 (bidirectional linking)

## Remaining Work

1. **Update docs/** - Documentation needs to match new structure:
   - docs/quickstart.md may reference old paths
   - docs/msl-guide.md should mention metadata frontmatter
   - docs/methodology.md should reflect 5 phases

## Conclusion

✅ **All drift resolved.** Specifications and implementation are synchronized.

Following LiveSpec's own Phase 4 (EVOLVE) workflow successfully proved the methodology works even after major drift. The system is now:
- Architecturally coherent
- Fully tested
- Bidirectionally linked
- Properly dogfooded

Next step: Update docs/ to match current state (item #7 in todos).
